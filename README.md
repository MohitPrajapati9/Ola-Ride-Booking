# 🚕 Ola Ride Booking Dashboard | SQL + Power BI Project

# Excited to share my latest data analytics project where I analyzed ride booking data (like Ola/Uber) using SQL and built an interactive 
  dashboard in Power BI.

# 🔍 Key Insights Extracted:
 - Top 5 customers based on ride count
 - Rides cancelled by drivers and customers
 - Average ride distance & customer ratings by vehicle type
 - Revenue from successful bookings

# 📊 In Power BI, I created visuals for:
 - Ride trends and cancellation breakdown
 - Revenue analysis
 - Ratings overview

# 🚀 Tools Used: SQL, Power BI
